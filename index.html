      Hello! My name is Jacob and I am 15 years old. I was born in Korea in 2001 and moved to the US in 2009. I am the youngest out of three boys. My oldest brother, David, is 21 years old, and he is in the korean military (mandatory for korean citizens). My older brother, Richard, is 19 years old and he was a mean brother until he got into college. Now, he is a totally different person. He is like the borther that you want for the rest of your life.

      I play a lot of musical instruments. For example, I play the violin, piano, guitar, and drums. I have lots of experience on these instruments, especially violin. I played many concerts in famous concert halls. For example, I played in Disney Concert Hall in 2012 in a group called SCYSO and played in Segerstrom Hall in June 25, 2016 as a concertmaster (first chair, first violin). It was an amazing oppertunity and a great experience. It was as if I was playing in a jewelry box.
