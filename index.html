      Hello! My name is Jacob and I am 15 years old. I was born in Korea in 2001 and moved to the US in 2009. I am the youngest out of three boys. My oldest brother, David, is 21 years old, and he is in the korean military (mandatory for korean citizens). My older brother, Richard, is 19 years old and he was a mean brother until he got into college. Now, he is a totally different person. He is like the borther that you want for the rest of your life.
